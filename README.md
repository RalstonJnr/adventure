# adventure

I started studying Information Technology and more specifically coding to solve problems but ultimately to build things for personal experimentation, 

This is a small project I built using HTML , CSS and Javascript to ask my now girlfriend on our first date.

Considering we are dating now , its safe to say it worked! 

This project showcase my understanding on HTML , CSS and Javascript.
